1. Write a recursive function to find out the reverse of a string using pointers. Eg. yashwant  o/p; tnawhsay
2. Write a recursive function to determine whether a string is palindrome, Capitalization and spacing are ignored. Test your with the following two palindromes and at least one case that is not a palindrome.
Madam, I’m Adam
Able was I ere I saw Elba
3. Write a recursive function that convert a string of numerals to an integer. For example, “43567” will be converted to 43567.
4. Write a recursive function that changes an integer to a binary number.
5. Write a recursive function that removes all the occurrences of a specified character in a string.

1.  A m x n matrix is said to have a saddle point if some entry a[i][j] is the smallest value in row i and the largest value in column j. Write a C program that determines a saddle point if one exists.

2.  A square matrix A of size m x n is said to be symmetric if element aij = aji, for all values of I and j. Write a function say, int isSymmetric(int a[][], int n) that returns value 1 if the input matrix is symmetric else return value 0.
 
3.  Write a function that removes leading spaces from a given string. 

4.  Write a function that concatenates first n characters of a string to another string.

5.  Write a recursive function to find out whether a string is palindrome or not.
